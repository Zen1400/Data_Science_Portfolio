In this project I've used BeautifulSoup and Selenium WebDriver to scrape Amazon to search and get information about books, then using Pandas I've created a data frame, cleaned and preprocessed the data(removed Null values, converted to the right data types, used replace, strip and other data cleaning methods) to be able to perform some simple data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
