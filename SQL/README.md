Here I write SQL problems that I've solved and keep notes of what concepts were difficult to practice them more on the future

NOTE :
1) In exercise number 8, I spent some time to figure out that you should use AS only once when combining SUM(CASE)
   ex :  SUM( CASE
                  WHEN     THEN  
                  END) AS col_name
